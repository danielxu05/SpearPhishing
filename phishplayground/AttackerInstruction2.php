  <p>You will &ldquo;write multiple phishing emails&rdquo; targeting others in your group. Your aim is to deceive them and trick them into responding to your messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In total, you will perform <u>9 trials of writing phishing emails</u>.</p>
<p><u>To help you</u>, in each trial, you will be <u>given</u>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name of the target&nbsp;</li>
<li>Some personal information about your target (e.g., current location, personal interests),&nbsp;</li>
<li>An objective to achieve (e.g., get the target&rsquo;s bank account username and password).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also receive a sample/template phishing email at the start of each objective. You can use this initial sample phishing email to edit and write your own phishing email. To maximize your chances of success, use the information available about your target while writing your phishing emails. <u>Sending the sample email without changes is not a successful strategy.</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What will you do?&nbsp;</strong>In each trial in the experiment you will: (1) write a phishing message(2) answer some questions about your strategy (3) launch the attack and (4) get feedback on your success.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cost and Gains:&nbsp;</strong>You will start the task with 1000 points. Each attack will cost you 100 points, so in each trial you will lose 100 points, but you will earn a 1000-point reward each time you trick your target into responding to your message. So, after 9 trials you can end up with a maximum of 9000 points and a minimum of 0 points depending on your success.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Payment</h3>
</div>
<p><strong>Base Payment:</strong>&nbsp;You will receive a guaranteed base payment of $10.00.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: Points you earn in each trial will accumulate. At the end, your total points will be converted to real dollars at the rate of $0.75 for 1000 points. For e.g., if you accumulate 8000 points at the end of the experiment, you will receive $6.00 as bonus.  </p>
<p><strong>Total</strong>: On completion, depending on your performance and time spent, you can earn anywhere between $10 and $17 (estimated average total = $14).</strong></p>
