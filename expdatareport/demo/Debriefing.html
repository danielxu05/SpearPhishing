  <p><strong><u>DEBRIEFING FORM</u></strong></p>
<p>Thank you for taking part in this research!</p>
<p><strong>Please read the material on this form carefully to learn important information about your experience in this study and mail us any questions that you have. After this debriefing, you may choose to have information we collected from you removed from this research study.</strong></p>
<p>For this study, it was important that we withhold some information from you about some aspects of the study.

<p><strong>What You Should Know About This Study</strong></p>
<p>Before you started participating in this research, you were told that the purpose of the study was to understand your decisions on email messages presented to you. However, the actual purpose of the study was to understand people&rsquo;s decision different types of phishing messages. So, among the regular messages you responded to, there were a small sample (&lt;10%) of messages with phishing intent. <b>There was absolutely <u>no risk</u> to your or your information because these were fake messages for the purposes of the experiment.</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We did not tell you the true purpose of the study because past research shows that when people are told it is a study on phishing, people become excessively cautious and suspicious of all the messages they receive and tend to classify majority as suspicious, artificially skewing their decisions, results and hence, invalidating the experiment.</p>

<p>Now that you know the true purpose of this research study, you may decide whether you want to have your data removed from the study or not.

We will retain only your Mturk ID for payment and accounting purposes. There will be no penalties or negative consequences for you if you withdraw from the study.
