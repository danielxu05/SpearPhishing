<center><h1><strong>Welcome to Email Decision Making Study</strong></h1>
    <h2> Please read the following consent form before proceeding</h2>
</center>

<p>We are asking you to be in a research study. This form gives you information to help you decide whether or not to be in the study. Being in the study is voluntary.</p>
<p>Please read this carefully. You may ask any questions about the study. Then you can decide whether or not you want to be in the study.</p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p>
<p>This task is part of a research study conducted by Dr. Prashanth Rajivan at University of Washington. The purpose of the research is to explore the various factors that affect email decision making.</p>
<p><strong>STUDY PROCEDURES</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the experiment, you will be making a series of decisions and writing involving one of three possible situations: 1) classification decisions, 2) choice decisions, and 3) decisions in competitive 2-person and more than two person games. Regardless of the particular situation you are presented with, your decisions will be separated in a number of trials and you will be provided with feedback that reflects the accuracy and effect of your decisions, according to the instructions provided in this experiment. The feedback will be shown to you in a number of points which are accumulated throughout the trials, and at the end of the experiment this will be converted into the total amount you earned. The accumulated number of points will represent the rewards you obtain for making accurate decisions.</p>
<p><strong>PARTICIPANT REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>Participation in this study is limited to individuals age 18 and older, currently residing in the United States, with at least basic computer proficiency, and the ability to read and understand English.</p>

You will only be eligible for compensation if you have completed the study in full and supplied the appropriate confirmation code. There is no partial payment if you do not complete the study. You will not be penalized if you choose to withdraw from the study without completing it, but you will not be compensated either.</p>
