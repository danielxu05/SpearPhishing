# SpearSim

The repository is the open source code for SpearSim experinment. We have designed a novel multi-player synthetic task environment for conducting laboratory experiments on spear-phishing attacks. Using SpearSim, we have conducted an experiment to understand how information exploitation in spear-phishing attacks influences end-user decision-making.

For more experinment design information, please see paper
